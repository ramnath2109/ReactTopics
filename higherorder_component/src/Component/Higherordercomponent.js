      <h1>Highe Order Component</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Higher Order Components (HOCs) are functions in React that take a component and return a new component with enhanced functionality. They are a design pattern used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and managing state in React applications.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Function that Accepts a Component:</span> A HOC is essentially a function that takes a component as an argument.</li>
            <li><span>Returns a New Component: </span>The HOC processes the input component and returns a new component with additional features or behaviors.</li>
            <li><span>Enhanced Functionality:</span> The new component returned by the HOC may have extra props, state, or behavior that the original component did not have.</li>
            <li><span>Usage: </span>HOCs are typically used to abstract common functionality that needs to be applied to multiple components. They can encapsulate tasks such as data fetching, state management, authentication, and more.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>1. Composition and Reusability</h2>
        <p>HOCs enable developers to compose complex functionalities by wrapping components. This promotes code reuse, as the same HOC can be applied to multiple components, abstracting common logic into a single reusable function.</p>
        <h2>2. Separation of Concerns</h2>
        <p>By encapsulating specific behaviors or functionalities within HOCs, developers can separate concerns effectively. This means components can focus solely on rendering UI while HOCs handle concerns such as data fetching, state management, or authentication.</p>
        <h2>3. Higher Order Functions</h2>
        <p>HOCs are essentially higher order functions, meaning they are functions that either take one or more functions as arguments or return a function. In the case of HOCs, they accept a component and return an enhanced version of that component.</p>
        <h2>4. Props Manipulation</h2>
        <p>HOCs often manipulate props by adding additional props, modifying existing ones, or passing down certain props to the wrapped component. This allows for the injection of data or behavior into components without modifying their original implementation.</p>
        <h2>5. Example Use Cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Authentication:</span> HOCs can handle authentication logic, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain components or routes.</li>
            <li><span>Data Fetching: </span>HOCs can fetch data from an API and pass it down to the wrapped component as props.</li>
            <li><span>State Management: </span>HOCs can manage state and pass stateful logic to components without them being aware of it.</li>
            <li><span>Styling:</span> HOCs can apply styling or theme information to components, enabling consistent styling across the application.</li>
            <li><span>Code Splitting: </span>HOCs can dynamically load components or resources, helping to optimize performance by splitting code into smaller, manageable chunks.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>6. Pitfalls and Considerations</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><span>Component Identity: </span>HOCs create new component instances, which can affect identity checks and lifecycle methods. Developers need to be cautious when using HOCs with React features like shouldComponentUpdate or memoization.</li>
            <li><span>Prop Conflicts:</span> HOCs may unintentionally override or conflict with props passed to the wrapped component. Proper prop forwarding or merging strategies should be implemented to avoid issues.</li>
            <li><span>Complexity:</span> While HOCs promote code reuse, excessive nesting or chaining of HOCs can lead to complex component hierarchies, making code harder to understand and maintain.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>7. Functional vs. Class Components</h2>
         <p>HOCs can be implemented using either functional components or class components. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components are often preferred due to their simplicity and flexibility. However, class components are still widely used, especially in legacy codebases.</p>
        <h2>8. Composition over Inheritance</h2>
        <p>HOCs adhere to the principle of composition over inheritance, which advocates for building components by composing smaller, reusable units of functionality rather than relying on class inheritance. This approach promotes code modularity, flexibility, and easier maintenance.</p>
